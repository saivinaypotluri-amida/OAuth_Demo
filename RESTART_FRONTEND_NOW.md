# 🔄 Restart Frontend to Fix 401 Error

## The Issue
You're seeing `401 Unauthorized` for `/api/auth/me` because:
1. ✅ The backend code fix is already applied
2. ❌ Your frontend is still running the old code
3. ℹ️ You need to restart the frontend to load the new code

---

## 🔧 Quick Fix (2 steps)

### Step 1: Restart Frontend

In your **frontend terminal** (where you ran `npm run dev`):

1. **Press CTRL+C** to stop the dev server
2. **Run again:**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

### Step 2: Clear Browser Data

1. **Open DevTools** (Press F12)
2. Go to **Application** tab
3. Click **"Clear site data"** or:
   - Expand "Local Storage"
   - Click on your localhost entry
   - Delete `access_token` and `refresh_token`
4. **Refresh the page** (F5)

---

## ✅ Test It Works

1. Go to http://localhost:3000/login
2. Login with your credentials
3. You should be redirected to the dashboard
4. No more 401 errors! ✨

---

## 📊 What to Look For

**Backend logs should show:**
```
INFO:     127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "POST /api/auth/login HTTP/1.1" 200 OK
INFO:     127.0.0.1:XXXXX - "GET /api/auth/me HTTP/1.1" 200 OK  ← This should be 200 now!
```

**In the browser:**
- Login redirects to dashboard
- Your name appears in the sidebar
- No error messages

## 🐛 Still Getting 401?

If you still see 401 after restarting:

### Check Browser Console
1. Press F12
2. Go to Console tab
3. Look for any errors
4. Check Network tab for the `/api/auth/me` request
5. Verify the Authorization header is present

### Verify Token is Saved
1. Press F12
2. Go to Application tab
3. Expand Local Storage
4. Click your localhost entry
5. You should see:
   - `access_token`: (long string)
   - `refresh_token`: (long string)

### Try Hard Refresh
- **Windows**: CTRL + SHIFT + R
- **Mac**: CMD + SHIFT + R

This forces the browser to reload all JavaScript files.

## 🎯 Alternative: Manual Login Test

If you want to verify the backend is working without the frontend:

### Using curl (PowerShell):
```powershell
# 1. Login
$response = Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/login" -Method POST -Body (@{username="your_username"; password="your_password"} | ConvertTo-Json) -ContentType "application/json"

# 2. Get the token
$token = $response.access_token

# 3. Test /auth/me
$headers = @{Authorization = "Bearer $token"}
Invoke-RestMethod -Uri "http://localhost:8000/api/auth/me" -Headers $headers
```

If this returns your user data, the backend is working correctly and the issue is purely frontend-related.

---

## 💡 Why This Happens

The issue is:
1. Login succeeds and returns tokens ✅
2. Tokens are saved to localStorage ✅
3. **BUT** the old frontend code has a race condition where `/auth/me` is called before the token is properly set in the request headers ❌

The new code explicitly passes the token in the headers, fixing this issue.

---

## 📋 Quick Checklist

- [ ] Frontend is restarted
- [ ] Browser localStorage is cleared
- [ ] Hard refresh done (CTRL+SHIFT+R)
- [ ] Login attempted
- [ ] Check backend logs for 200 OK on /auth/me

---

## ✨ After Fix Works

Once it's working, you'll be able to:
- ✅ Login successfully
- ✅ See your dashboard
- ✅ Access all features
- ✅ Configure services in Settings
- ✅ Use admin features (you're admin!)

---

**TL;DR:** 
```bash
# In frontend terminal:
CTRL+C
npm run dev

# In browser:
F12 → Application → Clear site data → Refresh
Login again
```

Should work! 🚀
