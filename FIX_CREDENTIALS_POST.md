# âœ… Fixed: Credentials POST 401 Error

## The Issue
When saving credentials (Slack, Azure OpenAI, Google OAuth), you were getting:
```
POST /api/credentials â†’ 307 Temporary Redirect
POST /api/credentials/ â†’ 401 Unauthorized
```

## The Fix
Updated the frontend to use `/api/credentials/` (with trailing slash) to avoid the redirect that was losing the Authorization header.

**File Modified:**
- âœ… `frontend/src/pages/Settings.jsx` - Line 33

No more 307 redirect!
