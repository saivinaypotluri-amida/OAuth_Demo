## 📊 Application Status

| Frontend | ✅ Ready |

## 🎓 Technical Details

### Password Handling
The system now automatically handles passwords of any length by:
1. Truncating to 72 bytes if needed (bcrypt limit)
2. Using UTF-8 encoding
3. Handling edge cases gracefully

**Security Note**: 72 bytes is plenty for strong passwords. A typical strong password (e.g., `MySecure#Pass2023!`) is only ~18 bytes.

### What Happens Next
When you sign up:
1. Password is hashed securely (with automatic truncation if needed)
2. User account is created in SQLite database
3. First user gets admin role automatically
4. You can immediately log in and start using the app
