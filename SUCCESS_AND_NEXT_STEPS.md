## 🔧 Minor Issue Fixed

There was a small issue with token handling after login causing `/auth/me` to return 401. I've just fixed it in:
- **`frontend/src/context/AuthContext.jsx`** - Now explicitly passes the token in headers

---

## 🔄 Apply the Frontend Fix

### Option 1: Restart Frontend (Recommended)
The fix is already in the code. Just restart your frontend:

```bash
# In your frontend terminal:
# Press CTRL+C to stop
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### Option 2: Clear Browser Cache
If you're still seeing issues after restart:
1. Open browser DevTools (F12)
2. Go to Application tab
3. Clear localStorage
4. Refresh the page
5. Login again
